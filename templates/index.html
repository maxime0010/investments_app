        <h2>Why This Investment Club?</h2>
        <p>Investing in stocks is the shortest way to the good life. Historically, stocks have consistently outperformed other asset classes like bonds and real estate. The S&P 500 has delivered average annual returns of approximately 7-10% after inflation.</p>
        <p>Top investors have even managed to consistently outperform the S&P 500 thanks to more advanced investment strategies. For instance, Renaissance Technologies has achieved around 40% annual returns after fees since its inception, while Berkshire Hathawayâ€™s shares have averaged about 20% annually.</p>
        <p>But achieving this performance requires access to advanced resources, including real-time financial information and quantitative analysis capabilities, that are traditionally reserved for large investment funds and top investment banks.</p>
        <p>We partnered with Benzinga, a full-service news and media company, to collect real-time market intelligence from the top analysts.</p>
